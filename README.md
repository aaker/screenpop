Demo app written during "Lets make an App" session of 2016 NetSapiens User Group

This is a very simple chrome extension demonstraiting the abilities of the NetSapiens api, https://api.netsapiens.com by registering a sip endpoint in JS and using chrome notifications to answer a phone call. Also leverages sipjs.com (https://github.com/onsip/sip.js) and was built of athe Notifications sampel app prodided by google. Simple Zendesk integration is shown, but disabled by default.  Its read for testing after you replace <CLINET_ID> and <CLINET_SECRET> in background.js and <API_URL> in manifest.json. 

Once installed as an extension user will need to go to the options and configure server name, login and passord and the extension with self configure from there after save.
